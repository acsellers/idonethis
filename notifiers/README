Notifiers are like desktop applications for iDoneThis

A Notifier needs a login window, a taskbar icon/indicator,
a little window to post new dones, a window that lists dones,
and a way to show notifications of new dones from team members.
It would also be nice to have a settings window, where you
could set how often new dones are checked, team members who get
checked, etc.

Current notifiers:

Ubuntu [Nofications, Login, Saved Passwords]
